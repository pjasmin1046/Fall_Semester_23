# Thermo_PS7 files
    Calculates fugacity coefficients for CO2 gas, and a binary mixture of CO2/H2O using the Peng-Robinson Equation of State (PR-EOS)

# Thermo_Project_1 file
    Provides temperature and pressure profiles for a hypothetical vehicle airbag derived from first principles based on the design constraints given in the problem statement. Design assumptions and constraints are commented within 
    the file.

# KMC_Langmuir file
    Conducts a Kinetic Monte Carlo simulation (KMC) of gas adsorption/desorption on a 2D lattice of a hypothetical substrate. 
    Rate constants and the effect of near-neighbor interactions can be manipulated, and graphical output of % surface coverage and the probability of each possible event over time is provided at the end of each simulation.
    Assumptions and design considerations are commented within the model.
